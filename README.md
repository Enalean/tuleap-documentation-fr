Tuleap Documentation
====================

This is a proposal to use Sphinx (instead of docbook) in order to generate the 
documentation for [Tuleap](https://tuleap.org/).

Build the documentation
-----------------------

    nix-shell
    make html

The documentation is generated in `tuleap-documentation-fr/_build/html/fr/` You can check the modifications by opening `index.html` with your web browser. You need to build the documentation in order to see your modifications.
